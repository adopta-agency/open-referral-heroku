title: 'Open Referral Heroku'
---

<p>This is a project for developing Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) implementations that run on the Amazon Web Services platform--this project is entirely managed via <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-Heroku">its Github repository</a>. This is designed to be a team effort, so if you see a project you'd like to know more about, and maybe one you'd like to tackle, submit an issue!</p>

<p><strong>Heroku Services</strong></p>
<p>These are the Heroku solutions that are currently being used or considered as part of delivering projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.heroku.com/platform" target="_blank"><strong>Heroku</strong></a> - Leverage Heroku as the data, API< and web layer for any API, or supporting application develop on top of it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tooling</strong></p>
<p>These are tools that are used as across any of the sub-projects included in this project.:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.openapis.org/" target="_blank"><strong>OpenAPI Specification</strong></a> - An API specification format used to define the request and response model for the API.</li>
  <li><a href="http://json-schema.org/" target="_blank"><strong>JSON Schema</strong></a> - A vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Projects</strong></p>
<p>These are the individual projects that are being built, or considered being built on Heroku:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HSDS PHP API Prototype</strong></a> - It would be nice to have a server side implementation of the HSDS API in PHP, that would run on Heroku.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Portal</strong></a> - A generic portal that can be stood up in front of any API deployed on the Heroku platfrom.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDS Node.js API Prototype</strong></a> - It would be nice to have a server side implementation of the HSDS API in Node.js, that would run on Heroku.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDS Ruby API Prototype</strong></a> - It would be nice to have a server side implementation of the HSDS API in Ruby, that would run on Heroku.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDS Python API Prototype</strong></a> - It would be nice to have a server side implementation of the HSDS API in Python, that would run on Heroku.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p>These are the communication channels used as part of this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-Heroku/issues" target="_blank">Github Issues</strong></a> - This is the Github issues for this repository, which is used as issue and discussion management for any HSDS Heroku project -- each project will have it's own issues, but this is meant to be the discussion at the top level.</li>
  <li><a href="https://openreferral.slack.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Open Referral Slack</strong></a> - The Slack Channel for the Open Referral organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop code and stories around using HSDS on the Heroku platform. Right now we are focusing on a simple server-side API implementation, but will be looking to develop other application that run on Github, as well as deploying as a plugin.</p>
<p>If you have a suggestion for a project, or want to get involved with any of the existing projects, just ping us on one of the channels above, and we'll see about getting you plugged in.
